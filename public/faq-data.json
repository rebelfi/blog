        "question": "Why are banks choosing to adopt existing stablecoins rather than issuing their own in 2025?",
        "answer": "Banks are prioritizing adoption over issuance due to three key factors: regulatory uncertainty around stablecoin issuance requirements, the significant infrastructure and compliance costs of maintaining a stablecoin, and the ability to capture most business benefits through integration without the operational burden. By adopting established stablecoins like USDC or USDT, banks can offer digital asset services to customers while avoiding the complex reserve management and regulatory obligations that come with issuance."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the main regulatory hurdles preventing banks from issuing their own stablecoins?",
        "answer": "The primary regulatory challenges include unclear federal frameworks in the US, with competing proposals from Congress and regulatory agencies; stringent reserve requirements that may mandate 100% backing with short-term government securities; ongoing debates about whether stablecoin issuers should be regulated as banks; and complex state-by-state money transmitter licensing requirements. Additionally, international banks face the challenge of navigating different regulatory regimes across jurisdictions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can financial institutions benefit from programmable stablecoin infrastructure without issuing their own tokens?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if a stablecoin loses its peg to the dollar?",
        "answer": "Reputable stablecoins like USDC and PYUSD are fully backed by cash and short-term US treasuries, audited monthly, and regulated by financial authorities. In the unlikely event of a de-pegging, most infrastructure providers have built-in safeguards including automatic conversion to other stablecoins or fiat off-ramps. Choose infrastructure that supports multiple regulated stablecoins to minimize this risk."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can programmable stablecoins handle complex B2B payment scenarios like milestone-based releases or multi-party escrows?",
        "answer": "Yes, this is where programmable stablecoins excel. Smart contracts can automatically release payments based on predefined conditions like project milestones, delivery confirmations, or multi-signature approvals. For example, a construction payment can be programmed to release 30% upfront, 40% at milestone completion, and 30% upon final inspection - all executing automatically without manual intervention."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do smart escrows work and what advantages do they offer over traditional escrow services?",
        "answer": "Smart escrows are self-executing contracts that hold funds and release them automatically when predetermined conditions are met. Unlike traditional escrows that charge 1-2% fees and require manual verification, smart escrows cost pennies to execute and operate 24/7. They eliminate counterparty risk, provide transparent tracking, and can incorporate complex logic like partial releases, time-based conditions, or oracle-verified external data."
      },
      {
        "question": "What yield generation opportunities exist with stablecoin infrastructure and how safe are they?",
        "answer": "Idle stablecoin balances can generate 3-8% annual yields through regulated lending protocols or treasury-backed products.
